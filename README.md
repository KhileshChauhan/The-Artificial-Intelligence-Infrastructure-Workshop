## About The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Workshop
Social networking sites see an average of 350 million uploads daily - a quantity impossible for humans to scan and analyze. Only AI can do this job at the required speed, and to leverage an AI application at its full potential, you need an efficient and scalable data storage pipeline. The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Workshop will teach you how to build and manage one. 

## What you will learn
* Understand how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are different from one another 
* Discover the data storage requirements of different AI apps using case studies 
* Explore popular data solutions such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
